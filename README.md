🪙 Counterfeit Currency Prediction – Regression Model (GBM & XGBoost)
This project builds a regression-based machine learning model to predict counterfeit currency sales using Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBM) and XGBoost Regressor. The solution leverages advanced ensemble methods to improve predictive accuracy and robustness.

📂 Contents
Jupyter Notebook: Complete data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

Dataset: Includes features such as counterfeit weight, medicine type, market price, area characteristics, and more.

Models Used:

Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBM)

XGBoost Regressor (XGB)

📊 Evaluation
Metric Used: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for measuring prediction accuracy.

The model minimizes MAE to improve reliability in currency counterfeit prediction tasks.

⚙️ Workflow
Data Cleaning – Handling missing values and encoding categorical features.

Feature Engineering – Extracting useful information from existing features.

Model Training – Using GBM and XGB for regression tasks.

Model Evaluation – Measuring performance with MAE. MAE- 756

Results & Insights – Comparison of models and feature importance analysis.
